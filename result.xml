            <paragraph>Where reference is made in Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC to Articles 9, 10 and 10a (balance sheet) or to Articles 22 to 26 (profit and loss account) of Directive 78/660/EEC, such references shall be deemed to be references to Article 6 (balance sheet) or to Article 34 (profit and loss account) of this Directive as appropriate.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>References in Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC to Articles 31 to 42 of Directive 78/660/EEC shall be deemed to be references to those Articles, taking account of Articles 45 to 62 of this Directive.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Where the aforementioned provisions of Directive 78/660/EEC relate to balance-sheet items for which this Directive lays down no equivalent, they shall be deemed to be references to the items in Article 6 of this Directive where the corresponding assets and liabilities items are listed.</paragraph>

(a)undertakings within the meaning of Article 1 of Directive 73/239/EEC, excluding those mutual associations which are excluded from the scope of that Directive by virtue of Article 3 thereof but including those bodies referred to in Article 4 (a), (b), (c) and (e) thereof except where their activity does not consist wholly or mainly in carrying on insurance business;

The total amount of such assets and liabilities shall be shown separately or in the notes on the accounts, broken down according to the various assets and liabilities items. However, the Member States may permit the disclosure of such funds as off-balance-sheet items provided there are special rules whereby such funds can be excluded from the assets available for distribution in the event of the winding up of an insurance undertaking (or similar proceedings).</paragraph>

            <paragraph>In the case of investments other than land and buildings, current value shall mean market value, save as provided in paragraph 5.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Where investments are officially listed on an official stock exchange, market value shall mean the value on the balance-sheet date or, when the balance-sheet date is not a stock-exchange trading day, on the last stock-exchange trading day before that date.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Where a market exists for investments other than those referred to in paragraph 2, market value shall mean the average price at which such investments were traded on the balance-sheet date or, when the balance-sheet date is not a trading day, on the last trading day before that date.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Where on the date on which the accounts are drawn up investments such as referred to in paragraphs 2 or 3 have been sold or are to be sold within the short term, the market value shall be reduced by the actual or estimated realization costs.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Except where the equity method is applied in accordance with Article 59 of Directive 78/660/EEC, all other investments shall be valued on a basis which has prudent regard to the likely realizable value.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>In all cases the method of valuation shall be precisely described and the reason for adopting it stated in the notes on the accounts.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>In the case of land and buildings current value shall mean the market value on the date of valuation, where relevant reduced as provided in paragraphs 4 and 5.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Market value shall mean the price at which land and buildings could be sold under private contract between a willing seller and an arm's length buyer on the date of valuation, it being assumed that the property is publicly exposed to the market, that market conditions permit orderly disposal and that a normal period, having regard to the nature of the property, is available for the negotiation of the sale.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The market value shall be determined through the separate valuation of each land and buildings item, carried out at least every five years according to methods generally recognized or recognized by the insurance supervisory authorities. Article 35 (1) (b) of Directive 78/660/EEC shall not apply.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Where the value of any land and buildings item has diminished since the preceding valuation under paragraph 3, an appropriate value adjustment shall be made. The lower value thus arrived at shall not be increased in subsequent balance sheets unless such increase results from a new determination of market value arrived at in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Where on the date on which the accounts are drawn up land and buildings have been sold or are to be sold within the short term, the value arrived at in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 4 shall be reduced by the actual or estimated realization costs.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Where it is impossible to determine the market value of a land and buildings item, the value arrived at on the basis of the principle of purchase price or production cost shall be deemed to be the current value.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The method by which the current value of land and buildings has been arrived at and their breakdown by financial year of valuation shall be disclosed in the notes on the accounts.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>
(a)If they have not been valued at market value, debt securities and other fixed-income securities shown as assets under C (II) and (III) shall be shown in the balance sheet at purchase price. Member States may, however, require or permit such debt securities to be shown in the balance sheet at the amount repayable at maturity.

(b)Where the purchase price of the securities referred to in point (a) exceeds the amount repayable at maturity, the amount of the difference shall be charged to the profit and loss account. Member States may, however, require or permit the amount of the difference to be written off in instalments so that it is completely written off when the securities are repaid. That difference must be shown separately in the balance sheet or in the notes on the accounts.

(c)Where the purchase price of the securities referred to in point (a) is less than the amount repayable at maturity, Member States may require or permit the amount of the difference to be released to income in instalments over the period remaining until repayment. That difference must be shown separately in the balance sheet or in the notes on the accounts.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Where debt securities or other fixed-income securities that are not valued at market value are sold before maturity and the proceeds are used to purchase other debt securities or fixed-income securities, Member States may permit the difference between the proceeds of sale and their book value to be spread uniformly over the period remaining until the maturity of the original investment.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The provision for unearned premiums shall in principle be computed separately for each insurance contract. Member States may, however, permit the use of statistical methods, and in particular proportional and flat-rate methods, where they may be expected to give approximately the same results as individual calculations.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>In classes of insurance where the assumption of a temporal correlation between risk experience and premium is not appropriate, calculation methods shall be applied that take account of the differing pattern of risk over time.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The life assurance provision shall in principle be computed separately for each life assurance contract. Member States may, however, permit the use of statistical or mathematical methods where they may be expected to give approximately the same results as individual calculations. A summary of the principal assumptions made shall be given in the notes on the accounts.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The computation shall be made annually by an actuary or other specialist in this field on the basis of recognized actuarial methods.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Non-life insurance
(a)A provision shall in principle be computed separately for each case on the basis of the costs still expected to arise. Statistical methods may be used if they result in an adequate provision having regard to the nature of the risks; Member States may, however, make the application of such methods subject to prior approval.

(b)This provision shall also allow for claims incurred but not reported by the balance-sheet date; its amount shall be determined having regard to past experience as to the number and magnitude of claims reported after the balance-sheet date.

(c)Claims settlement costs shall be included in the calculation of the provision irrespective of their origin.

(d)Recoverable amounts arising out of the acquisition of the rights of policyholders with respect to third parties (subrogation) or of the legal ownership of insured property (salvage) shall be deducted from the provision for claims outstanding; they shall be estimated on a prudent basis. Where such amounts are material, they shall be disclosed in the notes on the accounts.

(e)By way of derogation from subparagraph (d), Member States may require or permit the disclosure of recoverable amounts as assets.

(f)Where benefits resulting from a claim must be paid in the form of annuity, the amounts to be set aside for that purpose shall be calculated by recognized actuarial methods.

(g)Implicit discounting or deductions, whether resulting from the placing of a present value on a provision for an outstanding claim which is expected to be settled later at a higher figure or otherwise effected, shall be prohibited.
Member States may permit explicit discounting or deductions to take account of investment income. No such discounting or deductions shall be permissible unless:
(i)the expected average date for the settlement of claims is at least four years after the accounting date;

(ii)the discounting or deduction is effected on a recognized prudential basis; the competent authority must be given advance notification of any change in method;

(iii)when calculating the total cost of settling claims, an undertaking takes account of all factors that could cause increases in that cost;

(iv)an undertaking has adequate data at its disposal to construct a reliable model of the rate of claims settlements;

(v)the rate of interest used for the calculation of present values does not exceed a prudent estimate of the investment income from assets invested as a provision for claims during the period necessary for the payment of such claims. Moreover, it must not exceed either of the following:

the investment income from such assets over the preceding five years,
the investment income from such assets during the year preceding the balance-sheet date.When discounting or effecting deductions, an undertaking shall, in the notes on its accounts, disclose the total amount of provisions before discounting or deduction, the categories of claims which are discounted or from which deductions have been made and, for each category of claims, the methods used, in particular the rates used for the estimates referred to in the preceding subparagraph, points (iii) and (v), and the criteria adopted for estimating the period that will elapse before the claims are settled.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Life insurance
(a)The amount of the provision for claims shall be equal to the sums due to beneficiaries, plus the costs of settling claims. It shall include the provision for claims incurred but not reported.

(b)Member States may require the disclosure in liabilities item C (2) of the amounts referred to in (a).</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Pending further coordination, Member States may require or permit the application of the following methods where, because of the nature of the class or type of insurance in question, information about premiums receivable, claims payable or both for the underwriting years is insufficient when the annual accounts are drawn up for accurate estimates to be made.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Where one of the methods described in paragraph 1 is adopted, it shall be applied systematically in successive years unless circumstances justify a change. The use of either method shall be disclosed in the notes on the accounts and the reasons given; in the event of a change in the method applied, the effect on the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss shall be indicated in the notes on the accounts. Where Method 1 is used, the length of time that elapses before a provision for claims outstanding is constituted on the usual basis shall be disclosed in the notes on the accounts. Where Method 2 is used, the length of time by which the earlier year to which the figures relate precedes the financial year and the magnitude of the transactions concerned shall be disclosed in the notes on the accounts.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>For the purposes of this Article, underwriting year shall mean the financial year in which the insurance contracts in the class or type of insurance in question commenced.</paragraph>
